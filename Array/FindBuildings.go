/*
3714 Â· Buildings With an Ocean View
Description
Given an array of integers heights of length n, indicating that there are n buildings, heights[i] represents the height of the building at the corresponding position.

To the right of a building is the ocean, and for each building, if all buildings to the right of that building are strictly lower than it, then that building has a view of the ocean.

Returns a list of indexed subscripts of all buildings with an ocean view, in ascending order, with index subscripts starting at 0.

Example
Example 1:

Input:
heights = [5, 2, 3, 4]
Output:
[0, 3]
Explanation:
Building No.1 is 2 in height and Building No.2 is 3 in height and is not strictly higher than the building to its right
Example 2:

Input:
heights = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
Output:
[4]
Explanation:
There are no buildings strictly higher than the right side, so only the rightmost building, No. 4, has a view of the sea
